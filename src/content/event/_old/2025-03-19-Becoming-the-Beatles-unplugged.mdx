Becoming the Beatles is definitely not a tribute act. This theatrical event weaves together over 300 stunning projections, 20 live songs and fascinating behind-the-scenes stories. Yale-educated musician/storyteller Haley Marie orchestrates these elements as she guides you through the history-making events and heartbreaking moments of the Beatles.
