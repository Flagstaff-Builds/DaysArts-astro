Cristian de la Luna's pop-Latin-folk music is both contagious and inviting. This versatile artist that combines the simplicity of folk story-telling, Caribbean percussion and the jazzy warmth of brass instruments. Deeply rooted in his Colombian roots, he explores the four corners of his heart through the depth of emotions to the playful naivety of our childhood. Cristian has two albums to his credit, both in Spanish and in French. His performances are endearing and captivating.  His most recent record work ¿Qué Pasará? led him to great national recognition. Winner of the Edmonton Music Prize with an amount of $15,000 and the Envol Prize of the French Language Organization in Alberta (Le Rafa),  have catapulted him to be today among the most outstanding artists in the province. He is also nominated for the WCMA's 2023 Awards in the global music category.

“Mi casa es en todas partes” (My home is where we are together): Cristian seeks a communion with his audience. A ray of light, both his music and his lyrics are his invitation to a musical and impactful experience. His universal message calls us to live in the present and never stop dreaming.

His migratory journey from Colombia, through Quebec to finally arrive in Alberta has brought him inspiration in the nostalgia of his harsh exile from Colombia and the excitement of discovering a new land of welcome.
