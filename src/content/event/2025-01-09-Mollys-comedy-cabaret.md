Molly’s Comedy Cabaret is the ingenious musical comedy invention of award-winning actor/singer/writer Molly Wilson. Molly is described as “a charming powerhouse performer with a voice that takes your breath away.”

Every show on the Molly’s Comedy Cabaret roster combines charm and wit, packaged with hilarious takes on crowd-pleasing hit songs, clever writing, and the incredible chemistry between the performers. And that chemistry doesn’t happen by accident as Molly’s stage sidekicks are also her family. Her shows include the talents of mom Debbie “Hot Fingers” Wilson, dad Robert “Bob the stage manager” Wilson, and on occasion brother Josh “the stage manager” Wilson. Everyone in the family has performance experience that encompasses musical theatre, improv, stand-up, and more. It definitely makes for memorable family dinners!
