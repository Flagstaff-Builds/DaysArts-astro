## 🌟 Join the Reel Alternative Club at DaysArts! 🎥

### Experience the Unconventional
**Celebrate Over 20 Years of Unique Cinema at the Palace Theatre**
At DaysArts, we've proudly showcased "Reel Alternative" Movies alongside our regular screenings for over two decades. These aren't your typical Hollywood blockbusters. Think Academy Award nominees, independent gems, Canadian and foreign films. From comedies to dramas, biographies to documentaries, our selection brings the essence of film festivals and independent theaters right to your doorstep.

### A Tribute to Unique Storytelling
Our Reel Alternatives offer a cinematic journey beyond the mainstream. With the recent closure of Edmonton's beloved Princess Theatre, these unique film experiences are becoming rarer. But here at the Palace, we keep this vibrant culture alive.

### A Call to Movie Enthusiasts: Join Our Mission!
We invite you to be a part of preserving this cinematic treasure. By joining the Reel Alternative Club, you not only enjoy a year-round pass to these exclusive screenings but also become a vital supporter of alternative cinema.

**Membership Benefits:**
- **Annual Pass for Only $100:** Gain access to every Reel Alternative movie for 12 months from your purchase date.
- **Support Unique Cinema:** Your membership helps us cover the costs of acquiring these special films.

🎟️ **Get Your Pass!**
Passes are available at the theatre, or by reaching out to Sharon at 780-374-2403 or [info@daysarts.ca](mailto:info@daysarts.ca).
