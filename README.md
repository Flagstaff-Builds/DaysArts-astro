## üö® Emergency Developer Handover

If you're inheriting this project, here's what you need to know immediately:

### Tech Stack

## üìã Content Management (Keystatic CMS)

**Important**: This project uses Keystatic CMS for all content management. The old MDX-based approach has been completely removed.

#### 4. Contact Info (`/keystatic/contact-info`)
Centralized contact information:

### Showtime System
Movies use a simplified date-based showtime system:
- Each showtime = date + optional matinee checkbox
- **Regular showings**: Display as "Wed, Jun 25 (7:30pm)"
- **Matinee showings**: Display as "Wed, Jun 25 (2:00pm)"

## Movie Cleanup System

This project includes an automated cleanup system to remove past movies and keep the repository clean.

### Manual Cleanup Commands

```bash
# Test what would be deleted (safe to run)
npm run movie:cleanup:dry

# Actually delete past movies and their images
npm run movie:cleanup
```

### Automated GitHub Action

The repository includes a GitHub Action that automatically cleans up past movies daily:

**File:** `.github/workflows/cleanup-movies.yml`

**Schedule:** Runs daily at 6 AM UTC (midnight Mountain Time)

#### Setup Instructions:

1. **The workflow is already included** - no additional setup needed
2. **Manual trigger:** Go to Actions tab in GitHub ‚Üí "Cleanup Past Movies" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
3. **Monitoring:** Check the Actions tab to see cleanup logs and results

#### What gets cleaned up:
- ‚úÖ Movie `.mdoc` files where ALL showtimes are in the past
- ‚úÖ Associated image directories (`src/content/movie/images/movie-name/`)
- ‚úÖ Automatic git commit with cleanup details

#### Safety features:
- üîç Runs a dry-run first to log what would be deleted
- üìù Detailed logging of all operations
- ‚ö° Only deletes movies with ALL past showtimes (keeps movies with future shows)
- üõ°Ô∏è Error handling for missing files/directories

#### Customization:
- To change the schedule, edit the `cron` value in `.github/workflows/cleanup-movies.yml`
- Current: `'0 6 * * *'` (daily at 6 AM UTC)
- Example: `'0 6 * * 1'` (weekly on Mondays at 6 AM UTC)
